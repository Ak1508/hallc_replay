How to calibrate SHMS calorimeter with real electrons.

The calibration scripts reside in
hallc_replay/CALIBRATION/shms_cal_calib directory. They consist of 3
header files called THcPShHit.h,THcPShTrack.h, THcPShowerCalib.h, and
a steering script pcal_calib.cpp.

The scripts work on root files from hcana analysis and make use of
quantities pertained to tracking, heavy gas Cherenkov, and TOF from
hodoscopes. Hence it is convenient to calibrate on root files from
full SHMS analysis. The root files are assumed in a linked ROOTfiles
directory, under names shms_replay_<run_number>.root.

Once your hcana, hallc_replay and Root are set up, you can compile and
run pcal_calib under hcana, by issuing command

.x pcal_calib.cpp+("run number").

For instance, for calibration on shms_replay_464_50000.root file in
ROOTfiles, the correct commad would be

.x pcal_calib.cpp+("464_50000") .

Upon calibration, a canvas with representative plots will pop up. The
calibration constants will be written in output file
pcal.param.<run_number>, in a format suitable for plugging them into
your pcal.param file for subsequent use.

If you want to modify selection cuts used in calibration (cuts on
delta, beta, gas Cherenkov signals), you can find them at the
beginning of THcPShowerCalib.h file, in the #define directives.
