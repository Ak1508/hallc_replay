How to calibrate HMS calorimeter with real electrons.

The calibration scripts reside in
hallc_replay/CALIBRATION/hms_cal_calib directory. They consist of 3
header files called THcShHit.h,THcShTrack.h, THcShowerCalib.h, and a
steering script hcal_calib.cpp.

The scripts work on root files from hcana analysis and make use of
quantities pertained to tracking, gas Cherenkov, and TOF from
hodoscopes. Hence it is convenient to calibrate on root files from
full HMS analysis. The root files are assumed in a linked ROOTfiles
directory, under names hms_replay_<run_number>.root.

Once your hcana, hallc_replay and Root are set up, you can compile and
run hcal_calib under hcana, by issuing command

.x hcal_calib.cpp+("run number").

For instance, for calibration on hms_replay_303.root file in
ROOTfiles, the correct commad would be

.x hcal_calib.cpp+("303") .

Upon calibration, a canvas with representative plots will pop up. The
calibration constants will be written in output file
hcal.param.<run_number>, in a format suitable for plugging them into
your hcal.param file for subsequent use.

If you want to modify selection cuts used in calibration (cuts on
delta, beta, gas Cherenkov signals), you can find them at the
beginning of THcShowerCalib.h file, in the #define directives.
